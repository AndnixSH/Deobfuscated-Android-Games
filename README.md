# Deobfuscated-Android-Games
So basically I have de-obfuscated some games. 
The only games I have de-obfuscated is Pixel Gun 3D and Standoff 2 (old ver.)

Note: These both games aren't "fully" deobfuscated. 

Pixel Gun 3D: 5,000+ methods are de-obfuscated.

Standoff 2: 511 methods are de-obfuscated.
